<p> <b> Geodynamics </b> & <b> Geophysics </b> research fellow at <a href="http://www.ufl.edu/">University of Florida</a>. <p>
  The Hawaiian plume is the spotlight of my research. <br>
By means of the <a href="https://aspect.geodynamics.org/">ASPECT</a> code combined with seismic data, I develop joint geodynamic and petrologic models that help clarify its characterization, ascent, influence on the mantle flow patterns, and the internal distribution of key components such as eclogite. <p>
  Find out more about my projects or inquire below.
