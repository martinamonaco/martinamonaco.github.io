<p> <b> Geodynamics </b> & <b> Geophysics </b> research fellow at the <a href="http://www.ufl.edu/">University of Florida</a>. <p>
  The Hawaiian hotspot makes the spotlight of my research. <br>
By means of the <a href="https://aspect.geodynamics.org/">ASPECT</a> code, I develop high-level Geodynamics numerical models that observe, analyze, and quantify the percentages of denser eclogitic material that can be entrained by the rising Hawaiian plume. My studies help elucidate both the plume dynamics and the nature of the X-Discontinuity, a seismic discontinuity locally observed at around 300 km depth. <p>
  Find out more about my projects and publications. Inquiries are welcome.
