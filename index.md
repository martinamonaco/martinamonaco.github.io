<p> <b> Geodynamics </b> & <b> Geophysics </b> research fellow at <a href="http://www.ufl.edu/">University of Florida</a>. <p>
  The Hawaiian hotspot makes the spotlight of my research interest. <br>
By means of the <a href="https://aspect.geodynamics.org/">ASPECT</a> code, I develop high-level Geodynamic models that help clarify the nature of the X-discontinuity beneath the Big Island, Hawaii. My current project involves a quantitative analysis of the percentage of eclogitic material potentially entrained by the mantle plume throughout its ascent from the CMB to the surface. <p>
  Find out more about my projects or inquire below.
